# LaunchChecklist Form

This project utilizes CSS, JSON planetary information, HTML form validation and alerts, random number generation, and JavaScript to update the DOM on form submission.

I had a lot of fun with this one.

Check out the link at the bottom to see it in action.

## Requirements

I was tasked with the following:

Create a Launch Checklist Form for astronauts to fill out in preparation for launch.

1) Use preventDefault() to prevent a request from being sent out and the page reloading.
2) Validate the user-submitted data to ensure the following:
3) The user entered something for every field.
4) The user entered text for names and numbers for fuel and cargo levels.
5) With validation, update a list of what is currently ready or not ready for the shuttle launch.
6) Indicate what is good or bad about the shuttle and whether it is ready for launch by using the DOM to update the CSS.
7) Fetch some planetary JSON to update the mission destination with vital facts and figures about where the shuttle is headed.
8) Use whichever method you choose to randomly select the mission destination from the available options in the JSON file.
